# ASBA_virtual-assistants
Users’ opinions on a product are important for product development. 
In this project, users’ opinions about four artificial intelligence assistants from a discussion board, Quora.com, were collected for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). 
The proposed approach involves two tasks: aspect terms extraction and sentiment analysis. 
The feature terms were extracted using dependency relations and part-of-speech characteristics. 
The sentences were classified into positive, negative, neutral opinions by a lexicon named Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER), and so were the corresponding aspects. 
The results suggested the highest aspect rank of each virtual assistant and the corresponding improvements in need.
